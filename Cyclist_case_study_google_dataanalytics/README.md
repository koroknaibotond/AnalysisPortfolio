# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

This project analyzes the 2019 Q1- Q4 ride data from the Cyclistic bike-share program in Chicago to explore the behavior differences between casual riders and annual subscribers.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `data/` — Cleaned and raw datasets (not included in GitHub due to size), source of data: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
- `Cyclist_CaseStudy_processdocumentation.pdf` — Process journal and initial thoughts.
- `Cyclist_2019_Q1_Q4_analysis.pptx` — Presentation about the result of the analysis and recommendations.

## 📊 Business Task

**Goal:** Identify patterns that explain how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, and to use those insights to gain more annual subscribers.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Casual users peak in summer and on weekends, mostly near tourist areas.
- Subscribers peak in spring and ride more on weekdays — likely for commuting.
- Casual trips are generally longer in duration.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- R (Posit Cloud / RStudio) - for initial cleaning
- Excel - for analyzing and visuals
- Google Slides - for presentation

## 📌 Recommendations

- Launch targeted ads at high-traffic tourist stations during Q2–Q3.
